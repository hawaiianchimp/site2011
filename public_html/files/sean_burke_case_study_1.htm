<div class=Section1>

<p class=MsoNormalCxSpFirst align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:
200%'>Intel Israel Case Study</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>1) Do you agree with Don Frohman’s
decision in advance of the actual missile attacks to keep running Intel up and
running? What about after the actual missile attacks began?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Before I can agree
or disagree with Don Frohman’s decision to remain open before and after the attacks
occurred, there are a many factors to analyze. Prior to the first attack, nothing
like this has ever happened previously to Don Frohman, I would assume, so this decision
he would make would be a non-programmed decision. He would not be able to look
back to what other managers had done in a similar situation like he could with
a programmed decision. It is also important to recognize the time frame given to
Don to make his decision. Don needed to make a decision immediately because
there was no sign of when the missile attacks would occur. The only information
he could gather was that Iraqi Scud missiles, which may or may not be laden
with chemical warheads, were aimed in his direction, and were ready to be fired
at any moment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>After gathering
relevant information, Frohman would have had to weight his priorities in order
to come up with reasonable alternatives. He had to weight losing his employees
to a missile attack versus losing his business to competitors. If he closed
down the plant to protect the safety of his employees, then he would lose
business across seas to his competitors even before the missiles were launched.
However if he remained open and in full production to keep his business across
seas, the missile attacks could lead his employees to injury or death on their
commute to work. A situation like that could cause Don to lose a great deal of
money to workers benefits as well as to his business across seas and to his
reputation as an effective manager.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>On a business managerial
level, I believe Don made a great decision in compromising his alternatives to
remain open and to encourage, not force, employees to come to work. Being able
to make a compromised decision in a highly pressured environment like this one
shows that he is an effective manager. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>After the attacks
however, this would have been a bad decision. By remaining open with the
knowledge that there was an attack is risky. The moral rights approach to
making an ethical decision would consider that a person’s life is always more
important than a business. In this case, he is putting his business before his employees
safety by allowing them to come to work. He most likely stuck with his first
decision because he felt the effects of escalating commitment. In this type of
situation, people are looking for a leader who doesn’t<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>change his mind all the time. This is
where the norm for consistency puts pressure on his decision. He also stuck to
his first decision because retrospective rationality made him believe that since
nothing bad happened on the first attack, it is probably safe to stay in
operation. This also plays a role in prospective rationality because he
probably also believed that “prosperity was just around the corner” and that
the attacks would soon be over. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>2) Do you agree with Frohman should
have made the decision to remain open or close or should executives at Intel’s
corporate headquarters have made it?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>I agree that
Frohman should have made the decision and not the executives at Intel’s
corporate headquarters. A decision like this needed to be made quickly and
proactively. Having executives at the headquarters across seas would be a
lengthy process since the executives are so far away. <span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Decisions made by executives, assuming
that there are a group of executives, could also fall victim to groupthink.
This would lead to poor solutions and also exclusion of outsiders’ opinions
such as Frohman and other people in Israel. Another important factor in
influencing effective decision-making is the environment in which the decision
takes place. The executives are not in the same environment as Frohman, which
could lead to ineffective decision-making. I believe that Frohman should take
the executives’ opinions into consideration before making a decision because
this would be additional information that could be relevant to the process, but
I do not believe that the executives should make the final decision.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>3) What Criteria would you have
considered if you were in Frohman’s position? How would you have weighted these
factors?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>If I were put in
Frohman’s position, I would first want to find out as much information as
possible and as soon as possible in the given time frame. I would then gather a
small group of managers, not a large one, to help with the elimination of
alternatives. I would not want a large group because the larger the group, the
slower the decision making process and in this situation, time is short. I
would not ask the employees to join in either because there would be too many
conflicting opinions which would slow down the decision making process even
more. Further more, the workers input would most likely be irrelevant criteria
that would not contribute positive results to the process. I would then weight
the factors. I believe workers safety and families are far more important than
having a business stay in business. People can always find new jobs if the
company goes out of business, but they can only live once to have that
opportunity. I probably wouldn’t have come up with a great of a compromise as
Frohman did, but I after reading about that, I would chose that compromise.
After the first attacks however, I would shut down operation and have everyone
stay home because I weighted employee safety more than staying in business. </p>
